# Welcome to the LaTeX Book Tutorial!

In this tutorial, we'll be creating a book in LaTeX from scratch. We'll go through the process of setting up the content, the display, custom design, copyediting and proofing, preparing for printing, and conversions. The tutorial will be broken into lessons

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the lessons themselves. It's not necessarily meant to be viewed on its own, but can be if you want. If you want to go through the lessons one by one, you can do so through the page [LaTeX Book](https://makyo.github.io/latex-book).

This repository steps through the creation of a book through the use of git tags. You can follow along by pulling each successive tag. The `latex-book` repository uses git submodules to present each page as a lesson.

## Who are you?

I'm a giant nerd.

I'm also an editor, copyeditor, and layout designer for [Thurston Howl Publications](https://thurstonhowlpublications.com) and do this sort of stuff professionally. This tutorial was released initially as an in-house course.
